# Rules/Notes for the project

## Common abbreviations

- LUT: Look-up table. Used for color schemes.
- PL: Particle Life. A simulation of particle behavior.
  - IM: Interaction Matrix. A matrix of force relationships between particles.
- GS: Gray-Scott. A simulation of Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion.
- SM: Slime Mold. A simulation of slime molds.
- EM: Ecosystem. A simulation of an ecosystem.
- FF: Flow Field. A simulation of a flow field.
- WS: Wanderers. A particles and gravity simulation.

## LUTs (Color Schemes)

- LUTs are in planar format `[r0, r1, ..., r255, g0, g1, ..., g255, b0, b1, ..., b255]`
- Values are in the range 0-255
- A LUT can be "reversed" by reversing the order of the values in the array.
- A "stop" is some point in the LUT and LUTS have 255 stops. For example, choosing stop 128 means to use the middle color value of the LUT.

## State vs Settings

- **Settings**: Data that can and should be saved when saving a preset. These are user-configurable parameters that define how the simulation behaves.
  - Examples: agent count, speed, turn rate, diffusion rate, LUT selection, camera position, etc.
  - Settings are serializable and persistable
  - Settings can be modified by the user through the UI
  - Settings are part of the simulation's configuration

- **State**: Everything else that represents the current runtime condition of the simulation.
  - Examples: current agent positions, trail map data, simulation time, render loop status, GUI visibility, etc.
  - State is typically not saved with presets
  - State may be transient or computed
  - State represents the simulation's current execution state

This distinction is crucial for:
- Preset management (only save settings, not state)
- State restoration after simulation restart
- UI state management

## Tauri Notes

### Parameter Name Convention
- **Backend (Rust)**: Uses snake_case parameter names (e.g., `preset_name`)
- **Frontend (JavaScript)**: Must use camelCase parameter names (e.g., `presetName`)
- **Tauri automatically converts** between snake_case and camelCase
- When calling Tauri commands from frontend, always use camelCase parameter names
- The Rust function signature uses snake_case, but JavaScript invocations use camelCase

### Example
```rust
// Backend (Rust)
#[tauri::command]
pub async fn save_preset(preset_name: String) -> Result<String, String>
```

```javascript
// Frontend (JavaScript) - CORRECT
await invoke('save_preset', { presetName: 'My Preset' });

// Frontend (JavaScript) - WRONG
await invoke('save_preset', { preset_name: 'My Preset' });
```
