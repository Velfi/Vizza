//! # Simulations Module
//!
//! Contains the collection of interactive simulations that form the core of the
//! Vizza application. Each simulation explores different aspects of complex
//! systems, from particle physics to emergent behavior and pattern formation.
//!
//! ## Simulation Philosophy
//!
//! The simulations are designed to reveal the beauty and complexity that emerges
//! from simple rules. By providing interactive exploration of mathematical
//! systems, they offer both aesthetic experiences and insights into how
//! complexity arises from simplicity.
//!
//! ## Design Principles
//!
//! All simulations share common design principles that ensure consistent
//! user experience while allowing each to explore its unique domain.
//! The unified interface enables users to seamlessly transition between
//! different types of complex system exploration.
