# TODO

## Completed

- âœ… Complete Mouse Interaction Integration - Integrated MouseInteractionHandler into all simulations (particle_life, slime_mold, flow, gray_scott, pellets) and removed duplicated mouse handling code
- âœ… Complete Random Seed Integration - Integrated RandomSeedState into all simulations that needed it (particle_life, slime_mold, flow, pellets already had it)
- âœ… Complete Buffer Creation Migration - Replace remaining device.create_buffer_init calls with BufferUtils methods
- âœ… Complete Camera State Integration - Integrate CameraState into flow and slime_mold simulations
- âœ… Clean Up Unused Shared Module Functions - All clippy warnings resolved, no unused functions remain

## All Work Complete! ðŸŽ‰

All TODOs have been successfully completed. The codebase now has:
- Consistent use of shared modules across all simulations
- No code duplication for common patterns
- Clean, maintainable code with no warnings
- All simulations compile and build successfully
